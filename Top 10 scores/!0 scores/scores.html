              <p>
                AS Adema 149–0 SO l'Emyrne was an association football match played on 31 October 2002 between two teams
                in Toamasina, Madagascar. It holds the world record for the highest scoreline in any association
                football match, recognised by The Guinness Book of Records.
                SO l'Emyrne (SOE) intentionally lost the game against their arch-rivals AS Adema in a pre-planned
                protest over refereeing decisions that had gone against them during a previous four-team playoff
                tournament. By some considerable
                the match surpassed the previous-highest scoreline when Arbroath beat Bon Accord 36–0 in the Scottish
                Cup in 1885

              <h2>Dinamo București 11–0 Chimia Brazi (1974)</h2>
              <p>
                SC Dinamo 1948, commonly known as Dinamo București (Romanian pronunciation: [diˈnamo bukuˈreʃtʲ]) or simply Dinamo, is a Romanian professional football club based in Bucharest, that competes in the Liga I.

                Founded in 1948 as the team of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, following the merger of Unirea Tricolor and Ciocanul, Dinamo București has spent all but one year of its history in the top tier of the Romanian league system. Domestically, it is one of the two most successful teams in the country, having won 18 Liga I titles, 13 Cupa României, two Supercupa României, and one Cupa Ligii. In the 1983–84 season,
                 Dinamo became the first club in Romania to reach the semi-finals of the European Cup, being eliminated by Liverpool 1–3 on aggregate.

                <p>
                  On 11 April, 2001, the Australian and American Samoan national association football teams played each other in an Oceanian qualifying match for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. The match was played at the International Sports Stadium in Coffs Harbour, Australia. Australia set a world record for the largest victory in an international football match, winning the game 31–0. Australia's Archie Thompson also broke the record for most goals scored by a player in an international match by scoring 13 goals.[1] David Zdrilic, the scorer of eight goals in the match, scored the second-highest number of goals in an international match since World War I.

                  The outcome of the match led to debates about the format of qualification tournaments, with the Australian manager Frank Farina and Thompson feeling that preliminary rounds should be introduced to avoid such unbalanced matches, views shared by the international footballing body FIFA. It eventually led to the introduction of a preliminary round in the Oceanian zone qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The unbalanced level of opponents was also addressed by Australia's move to the Asian Football Confederation in 2006.</p>

                    <p>
                      The club was established in 1873 as Trinity Recreationists by the Reverend George Langton Hodgkinson, vicar of Holy Trinity parish, Gainsborough.[2] In 1889 the club were founder members of the Midland League, which they won in 1890–91.[3] The club finished as runners-up the following season and again in 1895–96, after which they applied for election to the Football League. In the vote they finished third, ahead of existing members Port Vale and Crewe Alexandra, and were elected into the Second Division.[4] The club's first season in Division Two of the League saw them finish seventh, but a gradual decline in form saw them finish in the bottom half of the table every season until 1904. In 1901–02 Trinity finished bottom of the division, but were re-elected.[5] In 1904–05 the club finished sixth in Division Two, their best performance during their Football League membership</p>

                      <p>
                        Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] (listen)), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football.

                         Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. </p>
